<p>  GitHub is a web-based platform that developers use to store, share, and collaborate on code. It uses a 
  version control system called Git, which tracks changes made to files over time, making it easy to manage 
  projects and work with others. With GitHub, multiple people can contribute to the same project from
   anywhere in the world. It's widely used for open-source and private software development, allowing users to 
   create repositories (repos), manage code updates, report bugs, review changes, and more. GitHub also 
   provides features like project boards, actions (for automation), and hosting for websites through GitHub 
   Pages.
